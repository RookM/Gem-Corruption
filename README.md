To view the website, all you have to do is open the index.html file. 
Please do not remove it from its folder or change the file names, as that will break the links in the HTML and CSS.
Otherwise, that is all you have to do in order to run this code.

Also, the three words at the top of each page are links, and you can use them to navigate between the three pages.
