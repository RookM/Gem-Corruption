To view the website, all you have to do is open the index.html file. 
It will probably work best if you click on the drop down menu that is green and reads "Code" and download it as a .zip file in order to open it.
Please do not remove it from the folder named "Gem Corruption" or change the file names, as that will break the links in the HTML and CSS.
You can extract it from the .zip file and save it though.
Otherwise, that is all you have to do in order to run this code.

Also, the three words at the top of each page are links, and you can use them to navigate between the three pages.
