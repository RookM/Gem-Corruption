                    <li><strong>Background and Purpose:</strong>
                        <p class="answer">A brief review of the literature on the subject of Crystalis Corruptus displays a striking lack of knowledge in the present field of research. 
                            Current publications on the condition are strictly theoretical, and I have been unable to locate any information regarding the status of a cure or any treatments in its stead. 
                            Upon consulting with my supervisor, I was able to confirm the status of this knowledge gap and determine the necessity of this research. 
                            From what I have gathered, sources such as On the Sunstones and their Nature: A Preliminary Observation by Spessartine AH20 and Spessartine VEH17 &lpar;Era 10, Eon 1&rpar; and "It's Quality not Quantity" by Bentioite 8CWH &lpar;Era 8&rpar; 
                            have indicated that Sunstone resistance to Crystalis Corruptus has yet to be studied by Olympian scholars, and research into the subject is most likely to yield vital results for further developments into gem pathology and the study of corruption.
                            Due to the current epidemic afflicting Olympia, the unavoidable spread of Crystalis Corruptus amongst our common citizens and Leuco authorities, research surrounding any potential cures for the affliction is not only important, but necessary.
                            This study intends to interview the leaders of the rival faction of the Pschent, also known as the Goa'uld, in order to search for a solution to this pressing problem.

                        <p class="answer">
                            As an emerging gem in this world, I find myself less tolerant of the suffering in the world that my elders and superiors have grown accustomed to.
                            To many, corruption is seen as an unfortunate fact of life.

                        <p class="answer">In addition, I am aware that a longitudinal study on Sunstones afflicted by Crystalis Corruptus would not only be unfeasible but also unnecessary for the subject of this study, especially as it would not provide the data necessary to answer my research question.</p>
