                    <li><strong>Background and Purpose:</strong>
                        <p class="answer">A brief review of the literature on the subject of Crystalis Corruptus displays a striking lack of knowledge in the present field of research. 
                            Current publications on the condition are strictly theoretical, and I have been unable to locate any information regarding the status of a cure or any treatments in its stead. 
                            Upon consulting with my supervisor, I was able to confirm the status of this knowledge gap and determine the necessity of this research. 
                            From what I have gathered, sources such as On the Sunstones and their Nature: A Preliminary Observation by Spessartine AH20 and Spessartine VEH17 &lpar;Era 10, Eon 1&rpar; and "It's Quality not Quantity" by Bentioite 8CWH &lpar;Era 8&rpar; 
                            have indicated that Sunstone resistance to Crystalis Corruptus has yet to be studied by Olympian scholars, and research into the subject is most likely to yield vital results for further developments into gem pathology and the study of corruption.
                            Due to the current epidemic afflicting Olympia, the unavoidable spread of Crystalis Corruptus amongst our common citizens and Leuco authorities, research surrounding any potential cures for the affliction is not only important, but necessary.
                            This study intends to interview the leaders of the rival faction of the Pschent, also known as the Goa'uld, in order to search for a solution to this pressing problem.

                    <li><strong>Personal Connection:</strong>
                        <p class="answer">
                            As an emerging gem in this world, I find myself less tolerant of the suffering in the world that my elders and superiors have grown accustomed to.
                            To many, corruption is seen as an unfortunate fact of life. I, unlike them, am entering this field of research with a new, open perspective and the curiosity necessary to solve this problem.
                            For this reason, I have selected the topic at hand to explore in my research.
                            Considering my previous supervisor contracted Crystalis Corruptus as well, there is a personal connection in this research, but as our predermined closeness was programmed and not experienced, I will maintain a lack of bias on the subject in this regard.
                            In order to ensure this is the case, I will request that my my supervisor, Dr. Theodore, and my assistant review the major steps in my research process, especially during the development of research questions and data coding.
                            I will also attempt to request a check-up on my own programming to ensure that there are no inserted biases that I am unaware of and unable keep in check.

                    <li><strong>Measures and Data to be Collected:</strong>
                        <p class="answer">
                            After obtaining a Sunstone subject through Olympian connections, I will amend my interview to better suit the individual in question and, once that is completed, begin the interview process. 
                            Due to the nature and distance of the Sunstones, I will be conducting these interviews through a third-party audio conferencing line. 
                            Preferably, this line will possess a feature to record our sessions for later transcription, but I will employ my assistant to transcribe the interviews if that is not the case.
                            One limitation of this method is the third-party source it will come from and the security concerns brought with it, and another is the secrecy with which any out-of-faction communications are handled.
                            Due to my position, I currently lack the necessary knowledge to engage in such communications, and thus will be relying on my supervisors to initiate the process.
                            Despite the concerns for security and anonymity, this is the only way that I will be able to engage in my study, and so it is a necessary step.
                            The data itself will include a discussion on a variety of personal experiences that have been attested to increase one's likelihood of corruption.
                            This list was put together by Olivine BA24O in Era 3, and it will be referenced during the development of interview questions as that process is finalized. 
                            In addition, as described in a theoretical process by Leona, Selenite H75, &lpar;Era 3&rpar; in her study on Sunstone culture, I will also explore their internal process of coping with high-stress situations, especially those that directly correlate with the contraction of Crystalis Corruptus.
                            Lastly, I will directly inquire about the methods used by the Sunstones to prevent corruption in the hopes that they possess any knowledge about their own internal functions and are willing to share it for the good of gemkind.
                            The first series of questions will allow me to determine if there are any trends within the data, specifically between causes for Crystalis Corruptus and a lack of contraction.
                            The second will allow me to receive the information necessary to answer my question.
                            Specifically, it answers the matter of how emotionally-induced Crystalis Corruptus can be prevented, and the manner in which one can do so.
                            Finally, if there is any response to the last series, then I will be able to eliminate or affirm existing results from my research and determine a theoretical solution.
                            Unfortunately, I am limited by the trustworthiness and openness of my subject&lpar;s&rpar;, and in turn will have to examine my results for credibility both during and after the interview process.
                            I am also limited in the number of potential participants for this study, and may need to rely on convenient sampling for the purposes of this research.

                            To begin my research, I will contact His Imperial Fortitude, The Supreme Chancellor, Ares, so that I may establish contact with one of the Sunstones.
                            After I have been paired with a Sunstone of his choice, I will ensure that my questions are applicable to the participant and review them with my assistant and my supervisor. 
                            Once that has been completed, I will establish a digital connection with the Sunstone and begin the interview process. 
                            As was previously mentioned, this connection will occur through a third-party audio conferencing line that I will be provided access to once my research has been approved.
                            If possible, I will use the line's recording feature to later transcribe the interviews or employ my assistant to do so instead.
                            This process will occur through a series of three interviews, the latter two with questions that are modified to suit the previous responses, and each will be set up in advance in order to prevent any scheduling conflicts.
                            In between each interview, the data will be analyzed and appended to a working theory as the research progresses.
                            At the completion of my research, the previous working theory will be amended using knowledge gained from the subsequent

                    <li><strong>Feasibility:</strong>
                        <p class="answer">I am aware that interviews with the Pschent are near impossible to obtain, even more so with gems as important as the Sunstones. 
                            Even so, I am also aware that a longitudinal study on Sunstones afflicted by Crystalis Corruptus would not only be unfeasible but also unnecessary for the subject of this study, especially as it would not provide the data necessary to answer my research question.
                            An experimental study would be unethical, and a survey would not allow for as much depth as is necessary for this study.
                            As a result, I have determined that my method is the most feasible and likely of the possibilities that I am presented with.
                            I acknowledge the limitations of my study regardless, considering the convenient sampling that will be necessary to obtain any participant for my research.
                            This, fortunately, is a necessary preliminary study in order to further additional research in the field, and, for that reason, my limitations are to be expected.
